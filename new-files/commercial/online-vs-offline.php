<h2>Embracing Convenience</h2>
<p>It's hard to discount just how much technology has changed our lives over the past two decades. Whether you are shopping, working, or keeping up with friends, the internet has made life infinitely more convenient. Yet nothing compares to the whole new world of entertainment that the web has singlehandedly ushered in. Online casinos give you the power to play instantly, from anywhere in the world, at any hour of the day.</p>
<p>Before the rise of internet gambling, playing at a casino was only convenient if there happened to be one in your city. Otherwise you would have to make the trek across the state or even beyond your own borders. That's a huge hassle if you want to play a few hands of blackjack. Yet internet gambling sites come with no commitment. There's no traffic to deal with, flights to book, or advance planning required. You just need to turn on your computer or grab your cellphone to start playing in seconds.</p>
<h2>Comparing Game Variety</h2>
<p>The world's best online casinos have several thousand slot machines and table games. Yet the average live casino pales in comparison. Many local casinos are brimming with slots but offer a limited selection of table games. That might not seem like a big deal if you don't mind being restricted to the most popular titles like blackjack or roulette, but if you feel like playing obscure poker variations then prepare to head home disappointed.</p>
<p>The average online casino offers hundreds of unique titles. In addition, you'll never have to wait in line for your spot at a crowded table since internet gambling sites can instantly create new tables to meet demand. It's not like they need to hire a construction crew to expand the casino floor. It just takes a little extra data on a server. More importantly, you will find a far wider range of stakes on the internet, especially at the lower end. While live casinos reserve games like baccarat for high rollers, you can easily play hands for a dollar on the web.</p>
<h2>Playing in Complete Comfort</h2>
<p>One of the great things about playing online is that you don't have to leave your house, but you don't need to get dressed either. You can easily enjoy poker in your pajamas or blackjack naked if you prefer and no one will be the wiser. What you wear and how comfortable you want to be is entirely up to you. Yet when you visit a live casino, you'll not only have to wear clothes, but some places even have dress codes. While a jacket and tie or cocktail dress is rarely required, you may be denied entry wearing flip flops or a tank top. Of course, some people do enjoy dressing to the nines. At the same time there is nothing stopping you from wearing a tuxedo while you play from the comfort of your kitchen.</p>
<p>Comfort goes beyond your attire. We've already mentioned the internet gambling sites never make you fight for a spot at a table. But did you know that online casinos are perfect for beginners? There's no table manners to learn or etiquette to master. You'll never have to worry about looking like a fool or being shamed in public by other patrons. Online play brings you unprecedented privacy, but you can also play at your own pace. Whether you prefer playing at a snail's pace or at the speed of light, internet casinos are ready to meet your needs.</p>
<h2>Getting the Most Bang for your Buck</h2>
<p>You already know that you'll find more flexible stakes when you play online, but did you know that internet gambling sites let you sample games for free? You can play just about every game for as long as you want just for fun. Whether you want to save your money or learn how to play, sites invite you to play with no commitment. Whereas offline casinos have to pay for staff and real estate, internet casinos have very little overhead. The cost of hosting a few free games on top of paid titles is negligible, which is why just about every site lets you play at no cost. Even the apps are entirely free.</p>
<p>For players who feel like opening their wallets, it's good to know that online casinos generally offer superior payouts. Your chances of winning are mathematically higher online. Internet slot machine payouts can be as high as 98% while some offline sites have yields of less than 80%. If you like roulette or blackjack, you'll find more variations online that improve your shot at winning.</p>
<h2>Finding the Right Ambiance</h2>
<p>If you're a fan of live casinos, you probably keep coming back for the ambiance. It's hard to discount the energy and excitement of the hottest spots on the Las Vegas strip. You simply can't carouse with strangers when you play from the comfort of home. In addition, casinos are now just a small part of entire entertainment complexes. When you head to a leading casino resort, you'll be able to live it up in the lap of luxury, watch critically acclaimed shows, head to the hottest clubs, and savor amazing food, even before hitting the gaming floor. Yet players also enjoy interacting with the dealers and staff too.</p>
<p>While you can't expect an internet casino to bring a Vegas grade party to your basement, online gambling has improved in recent years. Players can now enjoy live dealer games, which offer added realism. Unlike traditional computer generated casino games, live dealer games feature a real gaming table broadcast from the casino floor to your computer or mobile. It's fully interactive and hosted by a gorgeous croupier.</p>
<h2>Shopping Around for the Best Games</h2>
<p>One of the great things about Las Vegas is the number of casinos. If you don't like the vibe, game selection, or your performance, you can easily head down the street to dozens of other casinos. Unfortunately, not everyone can make it to the world's gaming capital. Many cities have just one casino, which means you're out of luck if you don't like the action. When you play online, dozens of award winning gambling sites are just a click away. The selection almost puts Vegas to shame.</p>
<p>Online casinos also give you the power to play more than one game at a time. If your poker tournament is moving slowly, you can easily play roulette while you wait for your turn. Try doing that at a live casino that's not in your dreams.</p>
<h2>Cashing in on Bonuses</h2>
<p>Although online casinos can't offer you free hotel rooms, complimentary cocktails, or the sprawling buffets that are the stuff of Las Vegas legends, there are plenty of perks on the internet. As you've probably heard, the online gambling industry is extremely competitive. With hundreds of sites vying for your attention, online casinos constantly try to one up each other hoping to earn your business. Most gambling sites give away cash just to get you through the virtual doors. You can also expect amazing rewards including cash back offers and all sorts of prizes.</p>
