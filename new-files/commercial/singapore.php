The Singaporean government isn't particularly fond of betting. Despite being home to two of Asia's best casino resorts, live gambling in Singapore can be a bit of a hassle for residents of the city-state. While foreigners have no trouble enjoying casino games in Singapore, citizens must purchase a costly permit at SGD 100 per day just to visit either casino. Fortunately, it is technically possible to wager on the internet, provided you know where to look. We're here to help you make sense of the rules and help you find the top gambling Singapore has to offer. <em>Our experts have found that X Casino offers Singaporeans the best table games in 2016.</em></p><p>Our Singapore gambling specialists have tested hundreds of sites to uncover the best online casinos that welcome Singaporeans. Here is what you can expect when you visit top gambling sites.</p><ul class="list">

<h2>Legal Gambling Considerations</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there aren't any local Singapore gambling sites? You can thank or blame the Remote Gambling Act, which effectively bans internet and mobile gambling. This legislation doesn't just prevent Singaporean companies from offering gambling. Singapore's government has also blocked many of the most popular global sites. The good news is there are still many great online casino options that are easy to access. You can log onto even more sites that offer casino online gambling in Singapore by using proxy servers and VPNs that virtually change your location.</p>
<p>Online casino gambling is a sticky subject when you think about it. When you enjoy games at a European casino from your home in Singapore, where do the games actually take place? Most technical experts would argue that the games take place in Europe or wherever the physical servers are. That's also where the casino is licensed and regulated. More importantly, that's where the computer code that makes the magic happen is executed. Like in many nations, laws pertaining to the internet are subject to change, especially in 2016. Of course, if you aren't comfortable embracing legal gray areas, you don't have to play for real money. Not only can you enjoy games just for fun, but many sites still let you win prizes and small quantities of real cash without depositing.</p>
<h2>Mobile Gambling in Singapore</h2>
<p>Despite Singapore's small size, there's always lots to do in the Lion City. If you are like most Singaporeans, you probably don't want to waste your life indoors. Fortunately, that no longer requires you to miss out on gambling. Singapore's leading casino online gambling sites are completely mobile friendly. Why stay home when you can enjoy casino online games just about anywhere on your smartphone or tablet? If you have a mobile device, you can find unlimited real cash entertainment no matter where you are. Why not hit the blackjack tables at the zoo? Have you ever dreamed about participating in a poker tournament while hiking through nature trails? It's all possible thanks to the power of mobile gaming.</p>
<p>Mobile gambling for Singapore players is fully compatible with all the most popular devices. If you have an iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Microsoft Surface, iPad, Android tablet or smartphone, you can enjoy the best Singapore gambling anywhere in the country. Just make sure you have enough battery power and a Wi-Fi or cellular connection. With mobile gambling, Singapore is just the beginning.

<div class="gamfaq"><h2>Singapore Gambling FAQ</h2><h3>What is the required age to play at a casino online?</h3><p>The legal gambling age in Singapore is 21. Yet many offshore casinos accept players as young as 18. If you are underage, you can still enjoy free games at many gaming sites. It's worth noting that betting sites are required to verify your age. When gambling, Singapore players should be prepared to send copies of their identification upon request.</p><h3>How is online gambling regulated in Singapore?</h3><p>When taking advantage of online gambling, Singapore doesn't play host to any sites. All of the internet sites that welcome Singaporeans are based abroad and out of your government's jurisdiction. That means you'll need to rely on the gambling commission or licensing authority in the region where your selected site is based. For your safety and security, it's important to play exclusively at regulated casinos. All trusted online casino gambling websites proudly display their credentials on their landing page.</p><h3>Am I required to pay taxes on my winnings?</h3><p>When gambling in Singapore, your real cash winnings aren't subject to taxes. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore taxes casino operators on their gaming revenue rather than player winnings.</p><h3>Can I play in SGD?</h3><p>When gambling, Singapore dollars are welcome at most sites. Yet since the SGD isn't a major world currency, you'll find that most sites denominate games in pounds sterling, euros, or US dollars. When you play at a reputable online casino, you'll receive a fair exchange rate when depositing or cashing out your winnings.</p><h3>What are the best sites for players?</h3><p>When gambling, Singapore bettors can count on great gaming sites. The best SG site for you will largely depend on which games you plan on playing. For example, the online casino with the best Texas hold'em tournaments isn't the top place to enjoy baccarat. We recommend checking out our in depth reviews and shortlist of the top gambling sites. It's brimming with incredible real money entertainment.</p><h3>What forms of online gambling are popular in Singapore?</h3><p>Roulette, sic bo, baccarat, poker, craps, slots and blackjack are the most popular types of gambling. Singapore gaming fans can actually enjoy hundreds of different games when you factor all the table and slot variations in 2016. Online Singapore gambling options are vastly superior to what you'll find at a live casino.</p></div>
