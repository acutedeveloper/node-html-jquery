<h2>A Whole New Way to Play at a Casino Online</h2>
<p>Live dealer baccarat gambling might seem straight out of science fiction. Yet when you think about it, live dealer baccarat uses a lot of the same technologies you enjoy every day. If you use Skype or FaceTime to chat with your family or friends, you know that video conferencing is the next best thing to being there. Gambling for live dealer baccarat players is just like being at the casino. Yet instead of having to waste your time stuck in traffic or worrying about who is going to walk your dog in your absence, you can bring the casino to you.</p>
<p>Before taking your seat, you'll have the opportunity to choose your table. Just like at an offline casino, you'll have a choice of croupiers. Today's live dealers aren't just friendly and skilled, but they are good-looking too. One of the great things about live dealer baccarat gambling is that the stakes are far more flexible than at your local casino. Games aren't just for high rollers and there's absolutely no intimidation. Did we mention that the video feed only goes one way? The croupier and other players won't be able to see you. Nonetheless, many casinos do offer a chat feature in 2016. Keep in mind that although the stakes are flexible, you'll need to bring your real cash. Free live dealer games are a rarity. If you aren't used to the game, it's best to practice on the computer generated tables.</p>
<h2>Mobile Live Dealer Baccarat</h2>
<p>Part of the beauty of live dealer baccarat gambling is that you can play anywhere.

The gambling world is your oyster if you have a smartphone or tablet. You can take your virtual seat at a live deal baccarat table anywhere there's an internet connection. Why not invite a croupier into your bedroom? How do you feel about having a little company while you eat lunch at your workplace cafeteria or soak up the sun at a poolside oasis? It's not only possible with your mobile, but it's unbelievably easy.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Live Dealer Baccarat </h2>
<h3>How does live dealer baccarat work?</h3>
<p>When you play live dealer baccarat, your gambling site will broadcast a real gaming table from the floor of the casino to your device. Some sites use dedicated gaming studios rather than real casinos, but the action is indistinguishable. Before you begin, you'll get to choose your live dealer or croupier, who will be responsible for dealing your cards and running the action. An intuitive interface makes it easy to place your bets and chat with the dealer.</p>
<h3>Where can I find live baccarat gambling?</h3>
<p>You can find live dealer tables at any of our highly recommended real money gaming sites. All our top gambling picks for 2016 are fully regulated and licensed so you can play with total confidence.</p>
<h3>How does live dealer baccarat compare to standard baccarat?</h3>
<p>When gambling, live dealer baccarat uses real cards rather than a random number generator. Although the odds are identical in both versions, live dealer games definitely feel more authentic. Live dealer baccarat also uses a croupier just like at an offline casino. If you are playing for real money, live dealer games will likely be your first choice wherever they are available.</p>
<h3>Can I use a strategy?</h3>
<p>When gambling, live dealer baccarat players can definitely use a strategy to reduce the house edge. The most popular strategy is to avoid betting on a tie and consider the commission when placing your bets. If the commission is low enough, it's generally worth betting on the banker every time, at least mathematically speaking.</p>
<h3>Can I live dealer baccarat on my mobile?</h3>
<p>Many casino online gambling sites do offer live dealer games for mobile devices. If you currently play games and stream videos on your smartphone or tablet, then your device should be able to handle live dealer baccarat. Just remember that you'll need to be connected to the internet while you play.</p>
<h3>Are live dealer games like baccarat fixed?</h3>
<p>Assuming you play at a respected casino that's fully licensed, you can count on fair games. When gambling, live dealer baccarat hands are monitored by a pit boss and the casino operations are routinely audited by third parties. Perhaps of greater consequence, live dealer baccarat gambling uses real cards rather than a computer algorithm, which would be far easier to rig.</p>
