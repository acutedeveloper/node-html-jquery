<h2>Legit Online Casinos in New Zealand</h2>
<p>When searching for online sites that offer gambling, New Zealand bettors will need to cast their net far and wide, at least geographically speaking. The Gambling Act 2003 requires casinos to be fully authorized by the New Zealand government in order to operate within our borders. That might not seem like a big deal, until you consider than the federal authorities don't presently grant license to internet gaming sites. Yet that's hardly a barrier to great legal entertainment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Kiwis can virtually head abroad to enjoy the action at offshore sites. These casino gambling sites welcome NZ players and New Zealand dollars. Since the games take place on foreign servers, they are governed by foreign rather than domestic laws. While it is illegal to set up an online casino within New Zealand, there are no laws preventing players from playing internationally. Just make sure you stick to regulated and certified sites. It's the easiest way to be sure the games are fair, your funds will be safe, and you'll have recourse if there are ever any difficulties.</p>

<p>The legal gambling age in New Zealand depends on the type of game you're playing. You'll need to be at least 18 to enjoy sport betting, lotteries, scratch cards, and gaming machines.
