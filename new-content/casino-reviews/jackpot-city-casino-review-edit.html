<h3>Jackpot City Casino Review</p>
<p>Players no longer have to drive for hours to get to the best city for casino games. Now, it only takes a few clicks of a mouse to start betting on video slots, progressive slots, table games and much more. Jackpot City Casino has all of this in a collection of over 400 options and it certainly adds its own style to the famed Microgaming software.</p>
<p>The website is designed to show the city that the online casino represents. Complete with large casinos where the action never stops, users can enjoy their favorite games at any time and they will get bonuses and rewards with every session. Bright lights show the known glitz found in Las Vegas but the online experience is much more accessible and convenient. The casino online first went live in 1998 and it is a member of The Palace Group, so it is not just a pretty site but also a perfect choice.</p>

</ul>
<p>The first impressions of Jackpot City Casino continue when it comes to the actual gaming lobby, which is rich in video slots. The spinning reels have many fans on the internet and they will certainly find something they like here.</p>
<p>One of the drawbacks of the casino is that it is not available in all countries and the most notable restrictions are the UK and the US. This is because the license in Malta does not cover these markets. Apart from this, the casino is very welcoming with international users since it covers quite a few languages and currencies.</p>

<h3>Software and Range of Games 3.9/5</p>
<p>Jackpot City Casino is a bit different from most other online casinos found on the Microgaming platform. It focuses on the Instant Play version rather than on downloadable software and it makes it very impressive. This isn’t to say that it doesn’t currently come with the option to download an application for desktop computers and it actually has more games than the ones found on the website. However, the sleek design of the online lobby and the fact that it has most of the great games make it the best way to play. There is even the option to add an icon to the desktop without installing the deluxe casino and thus make it easier to access.</p>
<p>On this non-download version, players can find more than 300 video slots, roulette, blackjack, table games, video poker, jackpots and categories for hot and cold games which are determined based on their recent return to player rates. On top of this, the live casino gets its own category. It is certainly a great platform that makes the software from Microgaming even more impressive than it normally is.</p>
<p>Slots - Yes, Poker - Yes, Live Games - Yes, Blackjack - Yes, Baccarat - Yes, Bingo - Yes, Keno - Yes, Roulette - Yes, Lotteries - No, Craps - Yes, Scratch Cards - Yes, Financials - No</p>
<p>With such rich variety, it is almost impossible to ever get bored at Jackpot City Casino. The games are very exciting and their graphics help keep players engaged at all times. Not to mention that all of them have high payout rates and so winning occurs very often.</p>
<p>It is possible to play for fun if you feel like you need to practice a bit before putting real money on the line or if you just want to enjoy your time. It is worth mentioning that making deposits will come with bonuses that allow you to bet for free but win for real. We will get to the promotional offers a bit later in the online casino review.</p>
<h3>Mobile Casino 4.3/5</p>
<p>Jackpot City Casino makes it very clear that it can bring some of the best casino games to smartphones and tablet devices. The ultimate portability for betting on different types of casino options is joined by perfect security and access to the same bonuses and promotions found on the full casino.</p>
<p>While the selection of games gets cut down significantly when making the switch to mobile, there are still more than 100 games remaining and all of them have been optimized for these mobile devices and their touchscreens. What makes it even better is that Microgaming didn’t randomly choose games when it went mobile and it made sure to have the hits and the new releases on the platform.</p>
<p>The focus we saw on instant play for Jackpot City continues on the mobile casino and the version of the website works on iPad, iPhone, Android and Windows. You can use the same account to continue while on the move and you will find mobile slots, mobile roulette, mobile blackjack and more mobile games. The wireless experience only requires an internet connection and it is perfectly secure when using real money and even making financial transactions from the cashier.</p>
<p>Jackpot City Casino is available on Apple iTunes with a free downloadable application for iOS devices with version 8.0 or later of the operating system.</p>
<h3>Security and Fair Play 4.5/5</p>
<p>Given the fact that the online casino was established in 1998, it has one of the longest histories and countless fans are in love with it. Security and fair play have big roles in keeping this great reputation and Jackpot City Casino has all the needed approvals.</p>
<p>First of all, it is owned by one of the most reputable groups of online casinos, The Palace Group. As a result, it is located in Malta and licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority for online gambling. The connections are secured by ESET and personal data is encrypted before being stored.</p>
<p>Jackpot City has also been awarded an accreditation from eCOGRA and it displays the average percentage payouts of all the games in a recent month. The RNG for blackjack, roulette and video poker has also been independently audited by the operator.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonus and Promotions 4.2/5</p>
<p>Simply joining the casino and making a deposit will be like winning a jackpot thanks to the welcome package. And it won't stop at only one payment as the $1,600 offer is available on the first four deposits, with bonuses of 100% for up to $400 available every time. No bonus codes are needed and players just need to register and click on Deposit Now to claim the free credits instantly.</p>
<p>Every month has prize-packed promotions and some of them can even award 5-star cruises or exotic holidays. Reload bonuses, free spins and cashback are very common to registered players at Jackpot City.</p>
<p>Being on the network operated by The Palace Group means that the casino has access to the Loyalty Programme where players get the benefits they deserve every time. The way it works is standard and points are offered for free as a way to reward each real money bet. There are six tiers that will have set bonuses and benefits while requiring a minimum number of points earned in a month to reach. The points are worth real cash money since every player can exchange the amount earned at any time from the cashier.</p>
<h3>Customer Support 4.2/5</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there is rarely a need to contact customer support at Jackpot City Casino, we didn’t overlook this crucial service and took it for a run just to see how it works and how the team responded to our questions. For getting in touch, the website presents several phone numbers that cover the big markets, along with an email address. The Help button in the top right corner can be used to start a window for live chat and also send a message by email through the web form. The service is open 24/7.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</p>
<p>Jackpot City Casino has a great image in the world of online casino games and we wanted to see just how good it actually is. After the detailed review, we can now safely say that it is all that it claims to be and more. From the moment we landed on the main page we were welcomed by a nice but simple design that made the site easy to navigate. It didn’t take long to see that the software is from the famous developer Microgaming and that there is a great deal of games to choose from.</p>
<p>New players who are interested in joining Jackpot City for the first time will receive up to $1,600 from four deposit bonuses and access to many promotions. There is even a loyalty program that can make sure winnings don’t just come from the games. With the secure banking system packed with payment methods and the helpful 24/7 customer support service, the casino has it all.</p>
