<h3>Spin Palace Casino Review</p>
<p>When it comes to online casinos using software from Microgaming, Spin Palace Casino is often times the first name that comes to mind. This website has been the go-to place for online slots and progressive jackpots for more than a decade and it isn’t showing any signs of slowing down. In fact, every year the online casino appears to be getting better and better and more players join the community.</p>
<p>At first sight, the site is nicely designed with cool colors and a style that resembles an exclusive casino where only VIPs are allowed to enter. However, it is actually very warm and welcoming to players from different countries thanks to the list of languages and the multiple currencies that can be selected. It promises a lot of hot games and it delivers in full while offering users the option to choose how to access the platform, be it by downloading the premium software, playing in Flash or HTML5 directly from the website or going mobile with the dedicated platform for smartphones and tablets.</p>
<h3>Hits</p>

<ul>
	<li>High wagering requirements for bonuses</li>

</ul>
<p>It is impossible to describe Spin Palace as being a small online casino when it has more than 600 games ready in the installed software. Even the Instant Play version is huge with over 250 video slots and many other types of casino games.</p>
<p>The ease of mind that comes with playing at such a famous online casino is hard to match and it gets even better when we consider that it is licensed by the Malta Gaming Authority. The website even displays the seal from eCOGRA on the bottom of the main page and this can be used as a way to get more information on the fair games and their actual return rates.</p>

<h3>Software and Range of Games 4.1/5</p>
<p>It is not a secret that Spin Palace Casino has a soft spot for online slots and it is the place where players can find hundreds of video online slot machines. Spinning the reels is very simple and when it comes to real money, you can expect to find progressive jackpots worth millions of dollars. The casino online is actually the place where several big prizes were hit recently and this shows just how reliable the operator is. Paying out a $7 million jackpot doesn’t happen every day but Spin Palace does it like it's nothing.</p>
<p>All of this and more is possible thanks to the high-end software from Microgaming. This is the provider responsible for keeping Spin Palace Casino entertaining and exciting. It is safe to say that it meets these requirements with a collection that is now over 600-games long and grows almost every month with the help of new slots that are created and launched on the platform.</p>
<p>The software is available by download and this is usually the best way to experience it at a full casino powered by Microgaming. It is free to take down from the site and it doesn’t take long to install. Spin Palace has a Flash Casino but this will have fewer games available.</p>
<p>Slots - Yes, Poker - Yes, Live Games - Yes, Blackjack - Yes, Baccarat - Yes, Bingo - Yes, Keno - Yes, Roulette - Yes, Lotteries - No, Craps - Yes, Scratch Cards - Yes, Financials - No</p>
<p>Fans of table games will not be disappointed if they decide to join this awesome casino. There are many different options available in both instant play and download and they are not just limited to blackjack and roulette, although these two represent a big chunk of the category. Baccarat, poker and craps are also very popular here and there is also a new live casino that takes the experience of betting on table games online to a higher level.</p>
<p>Video poker and specialty games complete the casino in classic Microgaming fashion to make sure that players never want for anything. This is especially true when it comes to the complete collection by download but can also apply to the instant version in most cases.</p>
<h3>Mobile Casino 4.2/5</p>
<p>Spin Palace Casino will not just create a unique gaming environment on computers but will also provide an awesome time on the touchscreens of smartphones and tablets. The mobile casino is very well organized and is all about offering an elite betting experience to customers, no matter where they are or what device they want to use. Compatibility is almost perfect since iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry, Windows and other smartphones will work perfectly.</p>
<p>The site nicely shows how to connect from the different mobile devices and operating systems mentioned before and the easiest way is to just go to the website. Yes, it is enough to just enter spinpalace.com on the mobile internet browser and you will get a version of the website dedicated to work on the smartphone or tablet used.</p>
<p>For having the mobile casino even more easily accessible, there is an app on iTunes that will work on iPad and iPhone. It is free, secure and receives regular updates that help make it better. Android devices do not have a native app from Spin Palace Casino right now but the instant version is just as good.</p>
<p>In total, the lobby will show about 100 video slots and this is quite a lot for a mobile casino. There are also some table games thrown in there, along with video poker and even some instant win games to make sure that everything is at your fingertips.</p>
<h3>Security and Fair Play 4.6/5</p>
<p>Our standards for online security and fair play are very high here at Gambling.net and we pay extra attention to these aspects of online gambling. We found Spin Palace Casino to meet our requirements in spades and its long-lasting record is flawless.</p>
<p>Now, the main license used by the casino online is from the Malta Gaming Authority and this allows it to operate in most markets. It is however not available in the United States.</p>
<p>On the subject of fair gaming, the Microgaming software is incredibly good and it only has games that have proven random number generators. The eCOGRA certification shows this very well and will actually present the exact rate at which all the games paid out recently. This percentage is usually over 95% so winning is a big part of being a client at Spin Palace.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonus and Promotions 4/5</p>
<p>Your experience at Spin Palace Casino can start today with a $1,000 welcome package. This sum is granted in three waves on deposits. First off is the 100% bonus that goes up to $250 and makes for a nice bankroll boost. While the percentage is smaller on the second deposit bonus, 25%, the maximum amount is bigger at $300. Finally, we have another bonus of 50% for regular customers that make a third deposit and claim up to $450 for free.</p>
<p>Unlike other online casinos, Spin Palace doesn’t show off any promotions on the site. This however doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have generous offers for its customers but they are always presented by email to registered players.</p>
<p>The Loyalty Club is very nicely organized to meet the demands of all types of online gamblers. Every player is entered from the first bet placed on the game and points are generated as more wagers are placed. The points will determine what loyalty tier each customer falls under and thus the eligible rewards. In addition, Club Points are also worth real money and can be exchanged at a fixed rate of 1,000 points for €10 at any time.</p>
<h3>Customer Support 4.4/5</p>
<p>Spin Palace excels when it comes to customer care and the support team is ready to help out 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The service is available in multiple languages and through several contact options but not all of them are open around the clock. For English, players can contact the support team, call the toll-free phone numbers listed on the site or send a good old email with the questions. A member of the team will gladly answer and provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</p>
<p>It is hard to find something bad to say about Spin Palace Casino and this doesn’t just happen by accident. The great rating that the online casino review shows is the result of more than 15 years of improvements and it embodies everything from the games to the withdrawal options. Software from Microgaming is always a good sign for an online casino and when the site has access to the full collection, things are very good and playing them is easily done across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>The welcome bonus wasn’t quite up to our high standards although it still makes for a good addition to the bankroll. More rewards will come along thanks to the Loyalty Club that makes it even more beneficial to be an active member of the community. In closing, Spin Palace Casino is one of the best casinos out there and it comes highly recommended.</p>
