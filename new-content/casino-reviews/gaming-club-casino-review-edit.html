<h3>Gaming Club Casino Review</p>
<p>The history of Gaming Club Casino goes all the way back to 1994, making it one of the first online casinos to offer real money gaming possibilities on the internet. This also means that its relationship with Microgaming is one that is very solid since the software developer was the first to create online casino games. Since then, many things have changed and many have remained the same, with Gaming Club continuing to be a top site with exciting ways to win for players from around the globe.</p>
<p>Being one of the oldest names in the business doesn’t mean that it is out of touch with the modern player. The website and the platform have been improving constantly over the decades and there is really nothing lacking from the current offer. At first sight, the layout of the site is different from what most other casinos have and this may take a bit of time to get used to. However, the games are always familiar and the iconic slots will stand out right away.</p>
<h3>Hits</p>
<ul>
	<li>Available since 1994</li>
	<li>Microgaming powers the casino</li>
	<li>Good welcome bonuses</li>
	<li>Player support 24/7</li>
	<li>Approved by eCOGRA</li>
	<li>Secure banking with plenty of methods</li>
</ul>
<h3>Misses</p>
<ul>
	<li>Does not accept UK or US players</li>
	<li>Slightly longer payout times than usual</li>
	<li>Clunky website interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, Gaming Club Casino doesn’t just have a few popular slots and that's it. The current portfolio from Microgaming has over 600 top games and they are all available at this online casino. Joining the hundreds and hundreds of online slots are other fantastic games that have countless fans. Betting real money on them is very secure and the many languages can make the casino feel like home, no matter where you are from.</p>
<p>There are some limitations to what the casino can do and while it has a Malta license, it does not provide full coverage. Some of the big markets require additional licensing or do not allow offshore sites to accept players. As a result, if you are from the States or from the UK, Gaming Club Casino is not available at this time.</p>

<h3>Software and Range of Games 4/5</p>
<p>We mentioned that the software is entirely from Microgaming. The developer is more than equipped to power a full online casino since its current list has over 600 entries across multiple game categories. It is also one of the most active software providers out there and it comes out with new slots very often. The lobby for playing on the browser is not that impressive and while Gaming Club adds its signature style to it, the visuals can use some work.</p>
<p>A thing to remember is that the large number mentioned earlier is not provided in the non-download version of the casino. As a player, you will have to install the software on a computer to get the full lobby. Differences can be seen in the groups but don’t change much for casual bettors. No matter the choice, slots are the go-to category and the many entries cover an insane variety of themes while having special features for generating more prizes and keeping things exciting.</p>
<p>Slots - Yes, Poker - Yes, Live Games - Yes, Blackjack - Yes, Baccarat - Yes, Bingo - Yes, Keno - Yes, Roulette - Yes, Lotteries - No, Craps - Yes, Scratch Cards - Yes, Financials - No</p>
<p>Online roulette, online blackjack and online video poker get a lot of attention at Gaming Club Casino and they come in different versions to meet the demand. Nice details and realistic graphics make the tables look like they do in a real casino and this can further be improved by going to the live dealer section for actual video of the croupiers. The casino is proud to have live versions of blackjack, baccarat and roulette.</p>
<p>Other table games along with scratch cards and more instant options make it a complete online casino where every customer can have a good time. Another popular category among online players has progressive jackpots for slots and other games, with Mega Moolah leading the charge with a jackpot that is usually around $10 million.</p>
<h3>Mobile Casino 4.1/5</p>
<p>The website shows from the start that Gaming Club Casino works on mobile devices and focuses on Android, Windows and iOS operating systems. These are the three big ones and combined, cover most of the smartphone market so it is very simple to play the games without having to be seated at a desk. Being available on your Android, iPhone, iPad, Blackberry, Windows and other devices is done with a version of the website that is able to change to match the system and the screen size. This also eliminates the need to download mobile apps if users don't want to add more icons on their phones.</p>
<p>A wide range of mobile games will be provided and the large buttons make it easy to register, sign in, deposit and bet with a few quick touches. Some of the featured titles include Major Millions, Tomb Raider, Thunderstruck, Break da Bank, Mega Moolah, blackjack, roulette, Jacks or Better and Double Double Bonus Poker.</p>
<p>Secure transactions are always guaranteed at Gaming Club Casino and the mobile platform is no exception. There are no compromises being made and the same high level of safety is available on your tablet or phone.</p>
<p>Although the website doesn't provide a direct link to it, iOS users can search for Gaming Club on iTunes and they will find a free app from the casino that they can install in order to access the mobile platform.</p>
<h3>Security and Fair Play 4.3/5</p>
<p>The Malta Gaming Authority is one of the highly respected legislative bodies for gambling online and it is responsible for many legit online casinos. Gaming Club Casino is also licensed under this jurisdiction while being managed by Bayton Limited and being a member of The Palace Group. All of these distinctions make it a reliable online casino.</p>
<p>Although it is a site that started in 1994, the security system in place uses the latest encryption technology to guarantee a perfect environment where users can use real money without running into any issues.</p>
<p>For fair play, Microgaming is trusted by millions of bettors and it is verified often by independent auditors. eCOGRA adds its seal of approval to the website and it is available for all visitors interested in the game return rates and RNG certifications.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonus and Promotions 4.1/5</p>
<p>The sign up bonus package may not be as big as the ones that other casinos have but the percentages are better. Recreational players can benefit the most from the offer since the maximum limits are not that big. After registering, the first payment will be matched 100% with up to $200 in free credits transferred instantly. Making another deposit will come with another bonus, this time of 150% up to $150.</p>
<p>More promotions on the network will make each month filled with reasons to celebrate and the bonuses will continue to roll in. Some of the special promos can even send lucky players on exotic holidays or award other impressive prizes.</p>
<p>All players who use cash money to bet will get extra rewards in the form of loyalty points. The reward system is very standard with online casinos nowadays and it is a way to keep track of all the wagers placed by each individual and generate appropriate benefits. Getting more points means more money but there are also tiers that once unlocked, can provide other rewards like faster withdrawal times, extra bonuses, gifts and entries to exclusive promotions.</p>
<h3>Customer Support 4/5</p>
<p>The support service at Gaming Club Casino is good but not that well organized. There are multiple phone numbers displayed on the site for different markets and a live chat can be started from the button for support. Emails can be sent by web form from the installed application and no matter what contact option is used, the team will respond promptly. 24/7 player support means that issues are never allowed to exist for long.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</p>
<p>With a vast selection of casino games, secure payment methods and generous deposits, it is hard not to like Gaming Club Casino. The review also pointed out some of its flaws since the website is not perfect and the promotional offers can have high wagering requirements attached to them. This however was not enough to discourage the many fans that have already signed up to the casino online and the many more that now have a solid recommendation to join.</p>
<p>Having the distinction of being online since 1994 adds another feather in its cap which is very nice and comes with the guarantee that it will not disappear tomorrow with your funds. It is reliable, secure and very welcoming thanks to the casino design. The great team working behind the scenes makes sure everything goes off without a hitch.</p>
<h3>FAQ</p>
<h3>Is Gaming Club Casino legit?</p>
<p>There really aren’t many casinos online today that have more than two decades of activity. Gaming Club Casino is one of the few and this goes to show just how legit it is and has been since its launch in 1994. The Malta Gaming Authority also agrees as this is the regulatory body mainly responsible for verifying the operator.</p>
<h3>What casino variations do they offer?</p>
<p>The Microgaming software is rich in all casino variations on multiple platforms. Table games can sometimes be overlooked but this is not the case at Gaming Club, even if slots exceed 400 titles and can cast a very big shadow. There are live dealer games, scratch cards and video poker included as well.</p>
<h3>Do I need to download any software?</p>
<p>The general recommendation is to download the software but the no-download interface has almost become just as good. Even if it has fewer games, it works really well and keeps the classic lobby that is familiar to a lot of players. It mostly comes down to what the customer likes as Gaming Club provides the options.</p>
<h3>Do they support mobile or tablet play?</p>
<p>You can take the casino with you and start it at any time from a mobile phone or from a tablet. It can be done by going to the site from Android, Windows or iOS devices but there is also an application that is found on iTunes and works on iPhone and iPad. More than 100 mobile games are available on any operating system.</p>
<h3>How fast do they payout?</p>
<p>The payout times are generally under 72 hours but they are mostly influenced by the methods. The shortest timeframe is of 24 hours and it is available for most of the big web wallets, while cards can take between three and five days. Bank transfers require extra verifications and are thus completed in up to six days.</p>
<h3>Are they safe and secure?</p>
<p>Everything about Gaming Club was built on the foundation of a secure environment. The technology is constantly improving in order to keep up with the latest protocols and make sure that your money and your personal information are safe at all times.</p>
