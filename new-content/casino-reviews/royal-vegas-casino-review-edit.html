<h3>Royal Vegas Casino Review</p>
<p>Royal Vegas has become synonymous with a good time. The online casino has a red theme for the website that makes it get noticed and also resembles a real casino where players can walk in and take a seat at the tables. Of course, this is even easier to do on the gaming site and the number of options is much larger, not to mention that bonuses and promotions are offered constantly.</p>
<p>Launched in the year 2000, Royal Vegas Casino has proven itself time and time again as being a secure site where real money transactions are made without any issues. From the very beginning, the casino online has been using software created by Microgaming and as the portfolio from the developer grew, so did the collection featured on the site. Nowadays it is the richest selection of online casino games on the same network from one provider and it has plenty of awesome video slots to show off.</p>

<p>The total number of games available at Royal Vegas Casino is close to 700 and this doesnâ€™t stay the same for long. Microgaming is always working on new creations in the slots department and Royal Vegas is quick to feature the latest releases. These can be found on the main page since it has categories for getting started as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Despite the multiple languages for the site and the many banking methods that cover local payment options, Royal Vegas Casino is not available everywhere. Due to regulations and restrictions, there are some countries which are not allowed to join and these include the United States of America.</p>

<h3>Software and Range of Games 4.1/5</p>
<p>There are many factors that contribute to the full website but the games are always important. Players will find a great deal of them at Royal Vegas Casino and this can be seen right away when going to the site. While the instant version has fewer games than the downloadable one, it is clear that there is no lack of options. More than 270 video slots are presented at this time, along with 55 table games, 20+ video poker versions, 16 progressives, 31 scratch cards and more than enough casual games.</p>
<p>The red button for downloading the premium casino software can be used to get the computer application for free and once this is installed, the lobby will have even more games available. The total is well over 600 and it comes from a boost in options across all categories. A good thing to keep in mind is that the new slots are launched on both of these versions and so players will not miss out on the hot releases if they just bet from the website.</p>
<p>Slots - Yes, Poker - Yes, Live Games - Yes, Blackjack - Yes, Baccarat - Yes, Bingo - Yes, Keno - Yes, Roulette - Yes, Lotteries - No, Craps - Yes, Scratch Cards - Yes, Financials - No</p>
<p>No matter which platform is selected, be it downloadable or non-downloadable, Microgaming is the software developer that powers the games. It is the brand that created most of the games and it also features a few extra options from other developers that work under the same network.</p>
<p>A thing that can go unnoticed at first sight is the live casino. On the website, the live dealer games are found in the category for table games and they are very fun to play given the authentic experience created. Roulette, baccarat, blackjack and even Sic Bo all come with live versions hosted at Royal Vegas Casino.</p>
<h3>Mobile Casino 4.3/5</p>
<p>Mobile gaming has recently become huge and Royal Vegas Casino has the platform to deal with the demand for mobile casino games. The site has information on how to get started on different operating systems and devices, as well as some of the top games that can be played on touchscreens.</p>
<p>First off, compatibility is very impressive. Android, Windows, iPad, iPhone and Blackberry mobile devices can all run the instant version of Royal Vegas Casino dedicated to betting on the go. The action can be started by just entering the site address on the browser and it will change to fit on the screen with the compatible games.</p>
<p>Also for playing on Android, there is a link to download the mobile casino software and have it installed on the smartphone. This will not take up a lot of space and can make it more convenient to play at Royal Vegas. iOS users have not been left behind either since there is an entry on iTunes for iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>Whatever the device and the preferred way of betting, Royal Vegas Mobile Casino will have the same $1,200 welcome package for the first three deposits, plenty of banking methods, multiple languages and more than 120 mobile games. Thunderstruck II, Hitman, Game of Thrones and Avalon II are just some of the famous mobile slots that are just a tap away.</p>
<h3>Security and Fair Play 4.4</p>
<p>128-bit SSL digital encryption is used at Royal Vegas Casino to protect all online transactions made to and from the site, as well as personal information entered when registering. This is unbreakable online security technology that is used by banks and major companies around the world. The operator also has a strict policy of not sharing client information with third parties so privacy is always assured.</p>
<p>The website is locked and secured when browsing and the application has been scanned for malware and came back perfectly clean. Furthermore, Royal Vegas is a member of The Palace Group and is licensed in Malta. If there are ever any issues, they can be sent directly to the Malta Gaming Authority.</p>
<p>Last but not least, eCOGRA has certified the casino for being safe and fair. The seal has great value among players since it comes with great transparency and provides useful information on the games and their pay rates.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonus and Promotions 4.1/5</p>
<p>The welcome bonus package does appear to be great but it falls a bit when looking at the percentages for the second and third deposits. However, the addition of lots of free spins on each payment does make up for it and can be very beneficial. Sign up today and claim up to $1,200 and 120 free spins as follows:</p>
<p>* First deposit: 100% bonus up to $250 + 30 free spins</p>
<p>* Second deposit: 25% bonus up to $200 + 40 free spins</p>
<p>* Third deposit: 50% bonus up to $750 + 50 free spins</p>
<p>The spins are available on certain games which may change to match new slots from Microgaming. Right now the offer is for Dragon Dance, Wild Orient and Suntide and the free spins are available on mobile and desktop.</p>
<p>The site always has a large promotion running and it usually lasts for an entire month, offering bonuses and rewards to participating players. Large prize pools, paid vacations and more can be yours so be sure to check out the latest promos.</p>
<p>A Rewards Programme takes care of users at Royal Vegas Casino by offering points when credits are wagered on the games. Slots have the best rate, while most table games are second and blackjack is last. 1,000 points can be used to get 1 cash credit for free.</p>
<h3>Customer Support 4.6/5</p>
<p>A very good customer support service is available at Royal Vegas. Although most players will never use it, we certainly checked it out in detail and were greatly impressed. Not only is it available at all hours of the day, but it has more contact options than normal and covers a long list of languages with dedicated phone numbers for the markets. Email and live chat can be used as well and the operator is even available by WhatsApp, Skype and iMessage.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</p>
<p>In conclusion, Royal Vegas Casino is the place where players can claim a large welcome package and get access to a huge collection of games. The $1,200 exclusive offer combined with more than 600 games really stood out throughout the online casino review and represents the main attraction. This isnâ€™t to say that the casino doesnâ€™t have other things going for it, such as secure banking, exciting mobile platform and an awesome support service.</p>
<p>There were some things that we didnâ€™t quite like and the site only has a part of the large collection mentioned. Also, the free spins in the welcome package are not available for all slots and so players will only be able to use them on some titles. These small drawbacks can certainly go unnoticed and donâ€™t really affect the majority of players that will surely fall in love with Royal Vegas Casino.</p>
