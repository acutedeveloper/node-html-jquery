<h3>Ruby Fortune Casino Review</p>
<p>Ruby Fortune really lives up to its name and welcomes customers from around the world with a nice looking website. The ruby colors make it nice to look at and the modern interface is very easy to navigate, while the fortune can start with a welcome bonus package before trying your luck at winning millions in progressive jackpots. With the goal of creating a fair, safe, easy and fun environment, the expectations are high for Ruby Fortune.</p>
<p>While it looks very new, the casino has actually been online for well over a decade, having been launched in 2003. Its list of games is always fresh however since it hosts hundreds of Microgaming games and adds new ones just about every month. Most of them are 5-reel slots with impressive themes and this is yet another advantage of playing here.</p>

	<li>Small reload bonuses</li>
	<li>Limited banking options</li>
</ul>
<p>It is clear that Ruby Fortune Casino is all about the community of players that bet here. It displays short quotes from some of its clients and also recent big wins from the games. Giving back is done through a welcome package that has three bonuses, loyalty rewards and around the clock care achieved with a professional customer support team.</p>
<p>The sad news is that the casino is not widely available around the world. Regulations regarding online gambling can differ from country to country and this means that Ruby Fortune is currently restricted in some places, such as the UK and the US. Its Malta license however is applicable in most other places and about a dozen languages are available for the website and by download.</p>

<h3>Software and Range of Games 4.2/5</p>
<p>There are so many games added to the online casino that even the website is a bit behind on the number. Nowadays, there are over 600 titles and all of them are on the network powered by Microgaming Quickfire. If you want to have all of these games just a few clicks away, you will have to download the Ruby Fortune software with one click and install it just as easily on a computer. Although there is a version of the casino that is readily available on the website, the total number of games is significantly smaller. Most players will not really notice this difference since the popular choices are available on both versions.</p>
<p>It's not a surprise to see that 5-reel slots account for the majority of games. What is really impressive is how many titles Microgaming can create with different themes and unique features and it is recommended to start with the latest games. If you want something classic, Ruby Fortune has 3-reel slots and fruit machines waiting in the instant play lobby.</p>
<p>Slots - Yes, Poker - Yes, Live Games - Yes, Blackjack - Yes, Baccarat - Yes, Bingo - Yes, Keno - Yes, Roulette - Yes, Lotteries - No, Craps - Yes, Scratch Cards - Yes, Financials - No</p>
<p>It is easy to get lost in the many spinning reels but this doesn’t mean that these are the only games. There are more than enough exciting table games that were designed to be realistic and the graphics cover the smallest details. Roulette, blackjack and baccarat get plenty of action and Ruby Fortune even has a live casino where the cards are dealt by real dealers.</p>
<p>On the subject of progressive games, Ruby Fortune doesn’t disappoint and it includes all of the big games from Microgaming that have growing prizes. Most of them are video slots, such as Mega Moolah and Major Millions, but there are also progressive jackpots for video poker and Cyberstud.</p>
<h3>Mobile Casino 4.2/5</p>
<p>Ruby Fortune Mobile is proud to cover all the big operating systems for smartphones and also for tablet devices. The software remains top-notch and while the number of games drops, players will continue to have their favorite games available at their fingertips. Seeing that one account is always enough to access the casino, no matter the platform, the same funds will be available at any time and so winnings can really stack up throughout the day.</p>
<p>The power is with the customer and the mobile casino does its part very well. Apple devices running at least version 8.0 of iOS have a dedicated application which can be downloaded from iTunes for free. This version of Ruby Fortune has been created for iPhone and iPad while keeping the elegant style of the operator. It is updated almost every month to make small improvements.</p>
<p>Android users don’t get a native application but this isn’t much of a drawback since the mobile website is available on this operating system, on iOS and on Windows. A smartphone can be used to go to Ruby Fortune Mobile Casino from the internet browser and play the mobile games from there.</p>
<p>The known philosophy that helped make the casino popular is applied on the mobile gaming environment so it has fair games from Microgaming, and plenty of them. It is easy to access, has safe connections for all customers and is always fun. Plus, text reminders are sent to present new promotions and special offers.</p>
<h3>Security and Fair Play 4.3/5</p>
<p>When browsing the Ruby Fortune website, you may notice that the connection is not always secured. This does cost it a few points but is not really important since the pages which require online security are protected carefully by known companies. McFree and TRUSTe have certified the site for being secure and private. The downloadable software is also clean and there is no need to worry about installing it on your precious home computer. At any time, you can uninstall it if you wish.</p>
<p>Ruby Fortune is one of the members of the large Palace Group and as a result is licensed in Malta. It has the seal of approval granted by eCOGRA displayed on the website and it is up to date with the recent evaluations of the games.</p>
<h3>Welcome Bonus and Promotions 3.9/5</p>
<p>Finally, we have arrived to the subject of interest of many customers. When the online casino is perfect and it has plenty of games, the final thing to consider is often times and welcome bonus. Ruby Fortune does have a standard offer for new players who register and make payments today but we were hoping to see something a bit more.</p>
<p>The first deposit bonus is 100% up to $150 and this is pretty good. However, the second bonus is of 50% up to $200 and the third will only offer 25% of the deposit in the form of free money for a maximum of $400. This brings the total to $750, which is not bad but also not that impressive.</p>
<p>Other promotions are generally surprises where customers are notified directly when available. As a result, there is no information available on the website but we can guarantee that the bonuses don’t just stop after the welcome package.</p>
<p>And on the topic of rewards, the Loyalty Club at Ruby Fortune is very good and it allows each player to work up the loyalty ladder in order to get improved benefits. When placing bets the program takes the amount and the game type into account and it offers points for free. It doesn’t matter if the bet was successful or a loss. When enough points are accumulated, they can be turned into cash money. The six levels each require players to earn an amount of points to enter and once inside, they will offer the corresponding rewards that can be bonuses, gifts, higher point rates and more.</p>
<h3>Customer Support 4.4/5</p>
<p>Problems may be rare at Ruby Fortune Casino but this doesn’t mean that it doesn’t take customer support seriously. In fact, the casino has an amazing contact section that shows several options to contact the team. English and some of the other languages have phone lines and live chat open 24/7 but there can be some limitations for certain options. Live chat, free numbers and email make sure that customers can get in touch within seconds if they have questions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</p>
<p>There is something about Ruby Fortune that makes it very pleasant. It has about everything you can expect from a leading Microgaming casino and it wraps it all up in a nice theme. 600+ games will look even better with $750 in the account for free and once the welcome package is claimed, more promotions will quickly follow.</p>
<p>The cashier didn’t have that many banking methods but it included local payment methods for countries around the world as well as international options that are usable almost everywhere. Making deposits is simple and secure, with the support team ready to lend a helping hand at any time. A big hit with today's online casino player is the mobile platform that is simple but very entertaining on the go.</p>
