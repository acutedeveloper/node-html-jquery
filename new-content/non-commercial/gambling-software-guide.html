<p>Title: Gambling Software Guide 2016 - Meet the Top Game Makers</p>
<p>Meta: Find out about the World's Leading Gaming Developers in the world of Gambling in 2016 - These are responsible for some of you favorite games &amp; titles.</p>
<h1>Gambling Software Guide</h1>
<p>If you've spent any time visiting more than a few of the internet's leading casinos, then you've probably noticed how similar they are. Naturally, most gambling sites have the same roster of core games, but that's just the beginning. You'll probably notice similarities in the graphics, soundtracks, layout, gameplay, and interface itself. This isn't a case of plagiarism or imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. In reality, most casinos use software from a handful of the world's leading gaming developers.</p>
<p>The vast majority of sites either license individual games or purchase complete gaming solutions that cover everything from the website, lobby, and cashier to the games themselves. Of course it's all customized with the site's theme and vision. While this might seem lazy, it actually provides players with the best possible gaming experience. The world's top developers not only invest millions creating award winning games, but they also create the code that makes fair gaming possible. Keep reading to learn more about the leading industry players and what makes for great software.</p>
<h2>Making Sense of Software</h2>
<p>When we speak of software, we don't necessarily mean downloadable games. A decade ago, casinos did require players to download and install the casino's software client on their PC, but times have changed. These days, software and apps are often optional. While some sites continue to offer games for download, instant play or non-download games that run directly in your web browser are gaining popularity. How you end up playing isn't just a matter of personal preference. It depends on what device you have and where you play. Your best bet is to visit a site that interests you for complete playing instructions.</p>
<h2>The Mobile Revolution</h2>
<p>Casino software developers have stepped up to the plate and knocked it out of the park with fantastic mobile games. Whether you have a smartphone or tablet, you'll have access to hundreds of titles. It makes no difference whether you have an iPad, iPhone, BlackBerry, Windows Phone, Microsoft Surface, or Android device. There are great apps or instant play games for every platform. We're sure you'll excuse the clich√© when we call mobile casinos a game changer, at least after you realize that you can play almost anywhere with no planning required. All you need is an internet connection. Of course you're free to play on your Mac, PC, Linux computer, or Chromebook if you prefer.</p>
<h2>Top Gaming Providers</h2>
<h3>Microgaming Software</h3>
<p>Widely credited for creating the world's first internet casino in 1994, Microgaming continues to dominate the gaming landscape.

The company also runs the popular MPN poker network. Most recently the company launched virtual reality gaming with an Oculus Rift compatible roulette game.

<h2>Behind The Scenes</h2>
<p>There's more to great software than just the quality and authenticity of the games. What you don't see is just as important. Fortunately, the leading software companies all have proven track records. You can put your faith in them knowing that the games are fair and the payouts are as advertised. In many cases you have multiple layers of protection as the gaming providers and individual casinos are both licensed. That doesn't even factor in all the additional certifications that go above and beyond to protect players.</p>
<h2>Picking Favorites</h2>
<p>While some players pay no attention to the software companies who create the games, most people end up having a favorite online gambling site as well as preferred games. Yet there's nothing stopping you from enjoying the games from several providers. In fact, many casinos offer games from multiple developers. Think of it as the greatest hits of gaming all in one convenient spot. Who wouldn't want everything they love in one easy to access package?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you'll probably pay more attention to the software if you play online slots, as some developers offer their multimillion dollar progressive jackpots across sites. Poker fans also tend to be concerned with the company behind the games, as it affects which poker network, tables, and guaranteed tournaments you can enjoy.</p>
